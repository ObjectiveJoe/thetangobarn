Ciao Felicia is a Portland, Oregon-based tango band that blends jazz and classical  influences with classic tango tradition. The band’s name playfully merges the pop culture phrase “Bye, Felicia” with the title of the traditional tango song “Felicia,” reflecting their unique approach to the genre.

Specializing in tangos, valses, and milongas, Ciao Felicia aims to provide authentic and engaging experiences for tango dancers and enthusiasts alike. The band has been a vibrant part of the local tango scene for many years and has recently exploded their activity in the post-pandemic era, performing at milongas and concert stages. Their performances not only cater to traditional tango settings but also reach wider audiences through various community engagements.

The band has been instrumental in creating the recurring Andina Milonga at the Portland’s iconic restaurant Andina—a highly successful event that has revitalized live tango music for dancers in the Portland metro area. They have also performed at outdoor milongas at Director Park, engaging directly with the Portland public through free events in a central location, and are frequently invited to perform at Tango Berretín, further solidifying their presence in the local tango community. Committed to community outreach, Ciao Felicia performed at Skyview High School in Vancouver, Washington, and at Alice Ott Middle School, collaborating with dancers Bassel Hamieh and Remanda Xiang to inspire and educate the next generation.
