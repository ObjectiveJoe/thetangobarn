            <h3>History of the Tango Barn</h3>
            <div>
                The Tango Barn is located on the historic
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_and_Estella_Adair_Farm">William and Estella Adair Farm</a>
                built in 1922 as a 115 acre dairy farm in Carnation, Washington
                in the lovely Snoqualmie River Valley. In November 1999, it was purchased by Joseph Hayes and converted into a multi-use farm including
                individual garden spots, horse boarding, and producing grass fed free range Wagyu / Kobi beef. It is also a bird watching paradise
                where the hawk and the eagle soar, the coyote roam and salmon swim.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                The idea for the Tango Barn came from the talented <a href="https://www.tangoenvie.com/">Sara Rose</a>. She had a dream of converting a historic barn into a
                place where people could enjoy the rustic beauty of the wooden structure while learning and practicing the art of Argentine Tango.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                Joseph began developing this dream with the help and support of his wife Diana Hayes. It took a number of years to
                do all the work necessary to make this beautiful barn a place in which we can foster the love for live music and Argetine Tango.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>Much of the original floor repair was done by Laurel Wittman. We were at a loss as to how to resolve the gaps in the 100 year old
            ship lap floor until Angela Ramsayer came up with the idea of routing the gaps and gluing in splines.
                With the help of Angel, Arthur Newmon,
            Andrew Walston and Joseph Hayes, we were able to save the original 100 year old floor and
                rehabilitate it into the beautiful floor you see below.</div>
            <br>
            <div>Many people helped us along the way including <a href="https://www.lavidastudio.com/">Kristina Ivanova</a>,
                <a href="https://www.lavidastudio.com/">Natasha Malteva</a>, Robin Kallsen and Rich Hinrichsen for encouraging us to go forward
                with the project, as well as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benthomasnotes/">Ben Thomas</a>,
                Stephen Brady, Mirta Wymerszberg, Stuart Zobal, Gabriella Condrea,
            Winnie Chueng and Hugo Satorre, and the amazing Pablo Inza & Sofia Saborido.</div>
