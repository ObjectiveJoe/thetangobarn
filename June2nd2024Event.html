                “Cafecito Tango Quartet” (Stuart Zobel, 7-string guitar; Obadiah Wright bandoneón; Benjamin Gifford, bass).

                <a href="https://www.obadiahdiazwright.com"><b>Obadiah Díaz Wright</b></a>
                I was born in San José, California, to a family of public school teachers. I graduated from Bard College & Conservatory with a B.A. in religious studies, and a B.M. in music composition. 
                After graduating, I participated in Stowe’s Tango Music Festival where I had my first bandoneón lesson and played cello in their orchestra. 
                I now live in Portland, Oregon, with my partner and five cats, playing bandoneón as much as I can.
